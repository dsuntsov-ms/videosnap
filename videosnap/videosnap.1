.Nm
is an OSX command line tool for recording video and audio from any attached
capture device.
.Pp
You can specify which device to capture from, the duration, encoding, bitrate, resolution and delay
period (before capturing starts). You can also disable audio capture. By default
videosnap will capture video and audio from the first found device at 30fps with
a Medium quality preset and a short (0.5s) warm-up delay.
.Pp
If no duration is specified, videosnap will record until you cancel with [Ctrl+c]
You can pause (and resume) recording with [Ctrl+z].
.Pp
You can also use
.Nm
to list attached capture devices by name.
